/** Chunk File.
    Simplified PNG/IFF like binary file format. It contains series of chunks.
    The first chunk type provides file signature.
    Each chunk contains both metadata (header) and data.
    Chunk bytes are { sizeof(Chunk), headerLength, dataLength }.
    The maximum length of chunk data is 64-bit value (16 exabytes).
    All multi-byte integers are in little-endian format.
    All integers should be aligned to file offsets by their size.
