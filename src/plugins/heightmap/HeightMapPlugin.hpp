/** Height Map Plugin.

    This class represents Height Map plugin.
    This interface is visible to the application.

    This plugin provides on-the-fly interactive preview functionality.
    Plugins with interactive preview inherit ModifierInterface.
    Plugins with interactive preview feature have more complex design
    compared to solutions which use simple modal progress bar. The reason is
    that interactive preview creates concurrent access to memory from multiple
    threads.

    Height Map plugin uses delayed lazy initialization of GUI widgets to
    save plugin loading time and memory.
